## Description:
The Work Scheduler Page is a deployed site that allows the user to create a schedule of their work day through creating memos and to-do lists throughout a 9AM to 6PM work day. The app then stores the user's input in local storage to restore their schedule later when needed. 

The Work Scheduler was created through use of JavaScript JQuery library and an HTML and CSS file.

In the JS file, functions have been created to designate an event litsener to each save button, a date selector and a dayjs API to allocate the time to each time block. A local storage function has been added to save the user's schedule.

HTML divs have been created to act as selectors for each hour in the day as well as the user's input in local storage.

## Installation:
To install, the user will need to clone the GitHub repo to their local storage and launch the index.html file to their local web browser or simply visit the deployed page here: 



## Usage:
To use the site, the user will simply type a memo or to-do task on a selected hour block. The text will be stored for later viewing through local storage and this can be seen via the web browser's inspect tab and then selecting the application tab.
